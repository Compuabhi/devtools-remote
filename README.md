This is an example of how [browser remote debugging](https://remotedebug.org) can be used to help customers having problems by enabling support agents to remote debug their browser.

### How to get started?
To get started to need to have three pieces going:

1. A simple gateway that acts like a proxy between Chrome and Chrome DevTools.
2. The user need to install a little extension to allow access to Chrome debugger, and to connect to the gateway.
3. The agent needs to open the dashboard to connect Chrome DevTools to the user.

#### Gateway
1. Run ``npm install``
2. Run ``npm start``

#### Customer
3. Install chrome extension by using the "Load unpacked extension" option
4. Open ``example/index.html`` in Chrome.
5. Click "I need help"

#### Agent
1. Open ``https://localhost:8000/json``
2. Find the ``devtoolsUrl`` property for the connected client
3. Open the ``devtoolsUrl`` url in Chrome
4. Bam!
